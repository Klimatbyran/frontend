# Klimatkollen Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of [klimatkollen.se](https://klimatkollen.se), developed using TypeScript, React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

Klimatkollen is an open-source, citizen-driven platform designed to visualize climate data. Currently, we are showcasing data from major Swedish companies and Swedish municipalities.

## 🚀 Project Structure

- **`src/pages/`**: Contains `.tsx` files for each page, which are routed based on their filenames.
- **`src/components/`**: Houses reusable React components utilized throughout the application.
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets such as images.

## 🗄️ Deciding on backend to run development client against

To run the local development client, you must run our API locally or connect to our production API. For information on setting up the API locally, see the [README](https://github.com/Klimatbyran/garbo) in our data pipeline repository.

If you instead want to run the local development client against production,
setup the local `.env` file for development by running the following command in
the root directory of the frontend code.

```
cp .env.example .env.development
```

## 🧞 Building and Running Locally

To run the project locally, execute the following commands from the root of the project in your terminal:

| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                         |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:5173` or
VITE_API_PROXY   |
| `npm run dev-gen` | Starts local dev server at `localhost:5173` and generate api
keys | 
| `npm run build`   | Builds your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `npm run preview` | Previews your build locally, before deploying |
