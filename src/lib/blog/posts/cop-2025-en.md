The global climate summit COP30 is now concluded. After two weeks of intense negotiations, the world was supposed to receive a roadmap for the necessary climate transition. The result was Global Mutirão – a text that **doesn't even mention fossil fuels**, the main cause of the climate crisis. Like holding a cancer conference without talking about smoking.

The meeting was strongly marked by its location: the Amazon rainforest and the clear presence of indigenous peoples who tried to make the countries listen. Yet, the forest received only a single mention in the final declaration:

*“…enhanced efforts towards halting and reversing deforestation and forest degradation by 2030 in accordance with Article 5 of the Paris Agreement…”*

At the same time, fossil interests continued to dominate the veto-based process. Authoritarian oil states like Saudi Arabia actively blocked language on phasing out fossil fuels, supported by, among others, India and Russia. Ironically, large parts of the Middle East might become uninhabitable within the foreseeable future. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian recently announced that [the capital Tehran needs to move](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202511209098) due to “ecological stress,” partly caused by drought – one of the clearest consequences of the climate crisis.

After 30 years of climate negotiations and 10 years after the Paris Agreement, emissions continue to rise. The reason is simple: fossil companies and oil states have successfully prevented the world from doing what is required. We need to reduce emissions by [at least 12 percent per year](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/win-race-against-climate-disaster-we-need-halve-emissions-over-next-five-years-2025-07-08/), scale up renewables, and protect nature. Just like the tobacco industry, fossil fuel interests are working with disinformation and delay tactics to sow doubt and sabotage the transition.

**Ensuring facts about the climate crisis and the solutions are available is therefore crucial – and that is the core of Klimatkollen's mission.** Our work is based, among other things, on Article 12 of the Paris Agreement and Goal 4.7 of the Global Goals.

In more positive news, at COP30, Sweden, along with nine other countries, signed a [declaration on climate information](https://www.unesco.org/sites/default/files/medias/fichiers/2025/11/cop_30_declaration_information_integrity_on_climate_change_12112025.pdf). The signatories promise to work for a scientifically grounded transition, strengthened access to climate data, and an active resistance against disinformation.

**This means, among other things, that the parties shall:**

- strengthen the role of civil society in counteracting climate disinformation  
- ensure transparency and access to reliable climate data  
- support campaigns that strengthen public knowledge  

**We look forward to seeing how the Swedish government will implement this.**

Here are some concrete proposals:

## 1. Stop dismantling civil society

The government should instead strengthen support for a vibrant civil society and increase opportunities for funding through state authorities.

## 2. Scale up popular education and training efforts

This can be done through communication initiatives from authorities, or in collaboration with civil society, trade unions, and study associations.

## 3. Make open data about the transition available

Without knowledge of what is being done – and what effect it has – we cannot scale up successful solutions. Sweden needs to invest in collecting and making open, local climate data available to all.

**Klimatkollen will continue to work to ensure that all relevant climate data is open and accessible to everyone. Through transparency, we gain the tools required to hold people accountable – locally, nationally, and internationally.**
