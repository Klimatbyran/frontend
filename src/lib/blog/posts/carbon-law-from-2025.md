# Q&A: Applying Carbon Law From 2025
[Read the white paper](/reports/2025-06-19_ApplyingCarbonLawFrom2025.pdf) - Created in collaboration with the Exponential Roadmap initiative, Johan Falk and Owen Gaffney.

## 1. What is Carbon Law?

The **Carbon Law**, proposed by Johan Rockstr√∂m, Johan Falk, and Owen Gaffney in 2017, is a science-based framework that outlines how the world can limit global warming to well below 2¬∞C, aiming for 1.5¬∞C. 

Inspired by Moore‚Äôs Law, it calls for exponential reductions in global CO‚ÇÇ emissions and provides a roadmap for governments, businesses, and cities.

**Core Concept of the Carbon Law:**

**1.** Halve global CO‚ÇÇ emissions every decade from 2020 onward.  
**2.** Double carbon removal technologies and capacity every decade.  
**3.** Reach net-zero emissions by around 2050.   

As of 2025, we're **five years behind** this trajectory. Emissions are still rising, and the carbon budget to stay below 1.5¬∞C could be exhausted in just six years.

**Klimatkollen‚Äôs response:**  
They propose a new reduction path starting from 2025 to help align with the Paris Agreement.

## 2. What is Klimatkollen‚Äôs adjusted emission reduction trajectory?

Using 2024 emissions data and the **Global Carbon Budget 2024**, Klimatkollen has recalculated the reduction path needed to stay within the 1.5¬∞C budget.

- **Updated rule of thumb:** Halve emissions every 5 years starting in 2025  
- **Equivalent to:** ~12% reduction per year  
- **Purpose:** A yardstick for companies, governments, and individuals to track progress

## 3. What are the details behind Klimatkollen‚Äôs calculations?

Based on remaining budgets from the Global Carbon Budget 2024:

| Warming Level (¬∞C) | 50% Chance Budget (GtCO‚ÇÇ) | Annual Reduction Rate (%) |
|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1.5                | 305                       | 11.72                      |
| 1.7                | 655                       | 7.38                       |
| 2.0                | 1,155                     | 7.38                       |


**Assumptions:**
- Residual emissions of 5.5 GtCO‚ÇÇ by 2050
- 50% probability of staying under 1.5¬∞C  
- Based on the paper *All options, not silver bullets, needed to limit global warming to 1.5¬∞C: a scenario appraisal* (2023)

## 4. Why recalculate the original Carbon Law?

Klimatkollen's mission is to increase public pressure on decision-makers and raise awareness through clear communication.

Due to that fact that the world has not followed **The Carbon Law** (halve global emission every 10 years from 2020 - i.e. 7% reduction per year) we need to recalculate the required trajectory - the "rule of thumb". 

The new proposed trajectory reflects this and provides a benchmark starting **2025**.

## 5. What if a company doesn‚Äôt meet the 12% annual cuts?

There are no legal obligations, but:

- It highlights the **step-change** needed to prevent dangerous warming.
- Cutting all GHGs and scaling removals is critical.
- ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never too late‚Äù ‚Äî every tonne and degree fraction matters.

---

## 6. Why is 1.5¬∞C important? Isn‚Äôt it too late?

> **‚ÄúGo beyond 1.5¬∞C, and we risk crossing irreversible Earth system tipping points.‚Äù ‚Äì Johan Rockstr√∂m**

- Global warming is accelerating.  
- 1.5¬∞C is the **safe operating space** for humanity.  
- Billions of lives depend on keeping warming under this threshold.

---

## 7. What is the global carbon budget?

A carbon budget defines how much CO‚ÇÇ we can still emit while limiting warming to a given target.

**Factors affecting calculations:**
- Temperature goal (1.5, 1.7, 2¬∞C)  
- Confidence level (50%, 67%, 83%)  
- Role of **Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)**  
- Residual emissions considered

Klimatkollen uses:
- IPCC-based carbon budget from **Global Carbon Budget 2024**  
- 50% chance to stay below 1.5¬∞C  
- Assumes 5.5 GtCO‚ÇÇ of CDR by 2050  

---

## 8. What does this mean for companies?

Klimatkollen provides visualisations to show how each company compares to the 12%/year pathway.

- Companies can use this as a **common reference**, regardless of base year or sector. 
- **Scope 3 emissions** (value chain) have been and are particularly challenging to reduce, but companies should be able to take advantage of the general movement in renewable energy and climate solutions moving forward.  
- Some rapidly growing climate-solution companies may motivate raised emissions over a period of time (e.g. renewable energy firms), since their solutions will displace the fossil-based products. (Example: [Exoponential Roadmap Initiative](https://exponentialroadmap.org/climate-solutions-framework/))

---

## What about other greenhouse gases?

The Carbon Law calculations **only cover CO‚ÇÇ**, not other gases like **methane**, which behave differently.

- Methane diffuses faster; CO‚ÇÇ persists for centuries.
- **Rapid cuts** in all GHGs are still essential.
