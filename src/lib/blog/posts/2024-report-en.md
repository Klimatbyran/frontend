## Overview

- 235 large companies account for **1,780 Mt** of greenhouse gases in 2024  
- Scope 1 and 2 emissions fell by **6%** and **14%**, but scope 3 rose by **18%**  
- **128** companies have science-based targets; **9** withdrew them  
- To meet 1.5°C, emissions globally must fall by **12% per year**  
- The report provides three recommendations to improve transparency and reduce emissions

## Report Highlights

In this year's edition of the **Corporate Climate Checker**, we worked with 2050 Consulting to analyse the climate reporting of 235 large companies for 2024, comparing both emissions and reporting with the previous year. Using a new calculation, based on the global carbon budget, we also show the rate at which emissions need to be reduced to align with the Paris Agreement.

The selection is based on our list of nearly 300 large companies, including:  

- Stockholm Stock Exchange Large Cap and Mid Cap companies
- major state-owned enterprises  
- major cooperative companies  
- large unlisted companies

Some have a broken financial year and have not yet reported new numbers. Another **26 companies** report no emissions at all.

This leaves **235 companies**, which together account for **1,780 million tonnes (Mt)** of greenhouse gases in 2024 — equivalent to **35 times Sweden’s** emissions, or just over half of the entire EU's emissions. Four giants report **1.2 billion tonnes of CO2e**:  

- **ABB**  
- **Traton** (including Scania)  
- **Volvo**  
- **Atlas Copco**

Note that some emissions are double-counted, as the companies are part of each other's value chains, but they are also under-reported because not all emissions in the value chain are captured.

## Emissions Trends

- **Scope 1** (own operations) decreased by **6%**  
- **Scope 2** (purchased energy) decreased by **14%**  
- Together (Scope 1 and 2) totalling around **3 Mt** 
- However, **scope 3** (value chain) increased by **18%**, from **1,478 Mt in 2023** to **1,750 Mt in 2024**

## Reporting and Targets

On a positive note, reporting has increased in all **15 scope 3 categories**, except category 8 (*upstream leased assets*) and category 13 (*downstream leased assets*). **14 companies** reported scope 3 emissions per category for the first time. The fact that the reporting is more comprehensive, is important because **98%** of the companies' emissions are related to scope 3.

It is also encouraging that so many companies have set science-based targets in line with the Paris Agreement. Of the 235 companies, **128** have adopted targets through the *Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi)*. However, **9 companies** have withdrawn these targets, which is worrying.

## Reporting Quality Issues

There are still clear challenges in climate reporting quality:  

- companies not following the **Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG)**  
- reporting emissions in home-made categories rather than international standards  
- missing or incorrect totals  
- missing breakdowns by scope or category  
- and one company even reported emissions in **grams (!)**

This makes it harder for both humans and machines to understand and compare data.

## Klimatkollen Calculations

According to Klimatkollen’s updated calculations, global emissions need to be reduced by around **12% annually** to meet the **1.5°C** target.

The results, from the 235 companies, show that emission reductions are far too slow – or that reductions in companies’ own operations are offset by substantial increased emissions in the value chain. 

It is of course very difficult to reduce companies' emissions by as much as 12 per cent per year, especially in value chains where they have less control. But more needs to be done for a credible pathway to net zero emissions.

## Three Recommendations from the Report

In this year's report, we also make three recommendations to accelerate the reporting of climate impacts to increase transparency and comparability – while helping to reduce emissions.

> **1️⃣ If you haven't started reporting yet — get started.**  
>  
> This applies to both large companies and small businesses. By calculating your carbon footprint and providing clear information on how you plan to reduce emissions, transparency and comparability will improve. Business decisions will be better informed. What is measured is tracked.

---

> **2️⃣ Improve your collection and methodology.**  
>  
> It is more important than ever to show genuine climate leadership — and that requires good data. Be clear on how you arrived at your figures and follow the GHG Protocol; otherwise neither humans nor machines can follow your work.

---

> **3️⃣ Recognise the benefits of active climate action.**  
>  
> With better data, your communication basis can become stronger and more accurate. Transparency and honesty about both challenges and successes are essential to avoid greenwashing and build trust in your brand.
