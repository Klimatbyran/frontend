If you’ve ever visited Klimatkollen and seen the label **“On Track for Paris Agreement”**, you may have wondered:

**How can an organisation be Paris-aligned if its historic emissions change rate is small, e.g. less than -5% per year? Isn’t the Carbon Law –11.72% per year?**

…you’re not alone.
This is a common question — and it makes perfect sense to be confused by this.

The surprising truth is that:
**historic percentages and Paris alignment measure different things.**

To explain this in a clear, human way, let’s step away from tonnes of CO₂ and use something more "grounded":

**a dirt pile, a wheelbarrow, and an approaching rainstorm.**

It turns out to be the perfect analogy for carbon budgets.

## A Pile of Dirt, a Deadline, and Uncertain Rain
Imagine you’re preparing your garden for a big project that will require a set amount of dirt, 300 kg to be percise. In the middle of your yard, a 300 kg pile of dirt has just been delievered to you. And you need to move it.

According to the weather forecast, a heavy rainstorm will likely begin in roughly **3 hours**. You want to finish moving all the dirt before the rain arrives — both to stay on schedule and to avoid extra work later.

You *might* get the full 3 hours… but maybe not. Finishing early is safer. But if you finish within 3 hours, you’re still OK.

This mirrors climate reality:
- We have a limited **carbon budget** we can “use” before we exceed 1.5°C.
- we don’t know exactly when we’ll cross irreversible thresholds, but we have an estimated deadline.
- Faster cuts reduce risk,
- but staying under the budget is what Paris alignment ultimately requires.

### 2. The Expert’s Advice: The Carbon Law Path  
A landscape expert gives you structured advice: “If you remove around 12% of what remains every 10 minutes, you’ll definitely empty the pile within 3 hours.”

This creates a **percentage-based pathway**:
- big removals early (when the pile is large)  
- smaller removals later (as the pile shrinks)

This is exactly like **Carbon Law (–11.72% per year)**:
- It’s not necessarily the perfect method  
- But it tells you the **minimum consistent rate** needed to remain within the goal  
- It assumes you will use **all** available time evenly

In other words:
**Carbon Law gives one valid strategy that can be applied at any scale (individual, company, nation) — but it's not the only strategy.**

### 3. Your Real-World Pace: The Trendline  
Now think about how you actually work.

For some people, they would rather move more dirt at the beginning and have less later when they are tired.

But from past gardening project, you know you naturally:
	•	fill and move a wheelbarrow with 10 kg every 10 minutes,
	•	consistently, without slowing down.

This is your “natural”, observed behaviour — your trendline.

At the start:
- 10 kg out of 300 kg is only **3%**  
- which looks far slower than the expert’s 12% recommendation

Later on:
- once the pile shrinks to 80 kg, that same 10 kg is **12.5%**
- once it’s 40 kg, it's **25%**
- near the end, one wheelbarrow may clear half the pile

Your effort stays the same, but the **percentage impact grows** as the pile gets smaller.

This is exactly how emissions trendlines work:
- early years look like small % changes  
- later years naturally become steeper % changes  
- because the absolute reductions stay constant

---

## Two Different Paths — Same Destination  
Here’s the key question when the rain finally arrives:

### **Is the pile gone? Did you finish in time?**

- If yes → you succeeded  
- If no → you didn’t  

Even if your early pace looked slow.  
Even if you didn't follow the 12% recommendation. 
Even if your path wasn’t exponential.

What matters is the **total amount moved** before the rain.

## How This Maps to Climate Math  

On Klimatkollen, we compare two things:

### 1. **Trendline Total (2025–2050)**  
If the organisation keeps reducing emissions the way it has historically,  
**how much will it emit in total by 2050?**

### 2. **Paris Carbon Budget (2025–2050)**  
How much can the organisation emit **while staying within a 1.5°C-aligned path**?

If the **trendline’s total emissions** are **lower** than the Paris budget:  
✔ **On Track for Paris**

If **higher**:  
✘ **Not On Track**

Simple. And based on total cumulative emissions — a scientifically important metric.

## Why Historic Percentage Reductions Can Mislead 
Back to the dirt pile.

Someone looking only at your early pace might say:

“You’re only removing 3% every 10 minutes! You’ll never finish in time!”

But that’s because they’re focusing on **percentages** instead of **actual progress**.

Your steady 10 kg pace naturally becomes:
- 3%  
- 4%  
- 6%  
- 10%  
- 15%  
- 25%  
…as the pile gets smaller.

Historic % reductions:
- reflect early behaviour  
- fluctuate based on noise  
- don’t account for your later acceleration  
- are not necessarily designed to answer the question: are you working towards a future that is aligned with the Paris Agreement

In 2050, if we look back, we would expect an **average** change rate between 2025-2050 to end up around the 11.72% mark if a company used up but did not exceed their allotted budget. But that does not say anything about the change rate for any single year.

## How Klimatkollen Actually Calculates This

Let’s put the analogy aside for a moment.
Here’s how it works in real data:
1.	We collect the best available emissions data.
	- Municipalities: fossil CO₂e from national databases
	-	Companies: Scope 3 when possible, otherwise Scope 1 & 2
2.	We establish the 2025 starting point.
	 - If real 2025+ data exists, we use it
	- If not, we fill the gap with the trendline
3.	We create two pathways from 2025:
	- Carbon Law Pathway → generates the Paris carbon budget
	- Trendline Pathway → extends historical behaviour into the future
4.	We compare the totals from 2025–2050.

That’s it.
The heart of Paris alignment is a budget comparison.

## When a Trendline Shows “Not On Track” 
There is one important caveat:
**Small early reduction percents are only OK, if the absolute reductions are still large enough relative to your starting level.** 

If your natural pace were moving only **5 kg of dirt every 10 minutes**, you wouldn’t finish the moving the necessary amount of dirt before the rainstorm hits.

Likewise:
- if the trendline shows too little reduction,
- or emissions flatten out,
- or cumulative totals exceed the Paris budget,

→ then the entity is Not On Track for Paris.

Not as a moral judgment — just as a mathematical assessment.

## One Final Note  
The Paris Agreement is fundamentally about the total carbon added on the way to net-zero.

The Paris Algined metric:
- is **not** a complete picture of all climate work  
- is **not** a prediction of future policy  
- is **not** an evaluation of adaptation or investments  

But it does answer the **most important question**:

### 🌍 **If we continue on our current path, are we staying within a 1.5°C-aligned future?**

That’s what our “On Track for Paris” means.

It’s one metric — not the whole story —  
but it is one of the **clearest signals** we have about whether we are moving fast enough toward a safer climate future.
