**Starting in 2025, the world must halve emissions every five years** if we want even a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C – the central goal of the Paris Agreement. That equates to emission cuts of **12 percent** every year. And right now, we’re far off track. Global emissions are still rising, and the tiny remaining carbon budget is shrinking by 3 percent – every single month.

At Klimatkollen, we recently did the math and published an analysis of how quickly we need to cut emissions **to stay within the remaining carbon budget** for 1.5°C. Calculations were based on the [Carbon Budget 2024](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/17/965/2025/essd-17-965-2025.pdf) paper and the [principles of Carbon Law](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2017-03-23-curbing-emissions-with-a-new-carbon-law.html), first proposed in 2017 by Johan Rockström, Owen Gaffney and Johan Falk, as a science-based pathway to achieve the Paris Agreement. Carbon Law was inspired by Moore’s Law in computing, providing a rule of thumb – halving emissions every decade from 2020 onwards. 

However, we are now five years behind schedule. As emissions are still rising, the global carbon budget to stay below 1,5°C has shrunk to a mere few years at current emission levels.

It’s easy to feel overwhelmed. The climate crisis is unfolding in real time – with broken heat records, extreme weather, rising seas, and food systems under pressure. Those hit hardest are the ones who contributed the least to the problem. 

But we know what needs to be done. We have the technologies and the solutions. And people everywhere support action – a [global survey](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-01925-3) found that **89 percent of citizens think their government should do more to fight climate change**. What’s missing is the courage to act in line with popular opinion and science.

Humanity is at a crossroads. One direction leads to deeper fossil dependence, escalating crises, and rising political instability. The other means dismantling the current fossil-based system, quickly, without crashing the economy – as it would likely lead to mass unemployment, uprisings and potentially pave the way for far-right governments that could upend all climate action. 

What is needed is a rapid transformation of our societies with justice at its heart, rewriting the very logic of how the global system operates today. We can, and must dare to dream to build something new: resilient, just, community-led and sustainable.  

It’s not easy. But continuing as we are is far more dangerous. And right now, we’re seeing signs of backsliding.

[Some companies](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/26/bp-drops-climate-targets-in-switch-back-to-oil-and-gas) are dropping climate commitments, and a recent [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02236-3) of the 2030 climate targets of 1,041 firms, published in Nature showed nearly 40% of companies missed or abandoned their goals with no consequences. The UN-backed coalition of banks, Zero Banking Alliance, recently voted to [drop the requirement to align financing with 1.5°C](https://www.esgtoday.com/net-zero-banking-alliance-drops-requirement-to-align-financing-with-1-5c/). Key European sustainability proposals, such as the Green Claims Directive and the so-called Omnibus, are being [paused or watered down](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/eu-halts-talks-law-tackling-companies-fake-green-claims-2025-06-23/). 

But this is exactly the moment we must remind ourselves – and our leaders – why we’re doing this. **We’re doing it because it’s morally right, because it’s possible, and because the time is now.**

So what does this mean in practice? It means that every political decision, every corporate strategy, every investment must place one thing at the very top of the agenda: rapid emissions cuts. Not small steps – but big leaps, 12 percent cuts every single year.

Either we transform our societies from the ground up – or we leave behind a world in chaos. The future will be radically different either way.
