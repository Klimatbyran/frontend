## 1. What is Carbon Law?

The **Carbon Law**, proposed by Johan Rockström, Johan Falk, and Owen Gaffney in 2017, is a science-based framework that outlines how the world can limit global warming to well below 2°C, aiming for 1.5°C. Inspired by Moore’s Law (which predicts exponential growth in computing power), the Carbon Law calls for an exponential reduction in global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions. This exponential trajectory is designed to align with the Paris Agreement goals, offering a simple, scalable, and science-based roadmap for governments, businesses, and cities.

The Global Carbon Law has influenced policy frameworks, corporate targets (e.g., the Exponential Roadmap Initiative), and scientific discussions on possible pathways for climate stabilization.

**Core Concept of the Carbon Law:**

**1.** Halve global CO₂ emissions every decade from 2020 onward.
**2.** Double carbon removal technologies and capacity every decade.
**3.** Reach net-zero emissions by around 2050.

However, in 2025 we are now five years behind the proposed carbon emission reduction trajectory, proposed in the Carbon Law. Emissions are still rising, and the global carbon budget to stay below 1,5°C has shrunk. At current levels, it will run out in only six years.

Therefore, Klimatkollen has calculated a new pace of emissions reductions needed to stay within the remaining budget, based on 2025 as a starting point. It aims to give states, organisations and companies a rule of thumb by which to measure science-aligned emission cuts.

## 2. What is Klimatkollen’s adjusted emission reductions trajectory and how can it be used?

Based on the level of emissions 2024, and the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C, as outlined in the [Global Carbon Budget 2024](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/17/965/2025/essd-17-965-2025.pdf), Klimatkollen has recalculated the pace of emission cuts needed to stay within this crucial threshold for humanity.

An updated Carbon Law rule of thumb means halving global emissions every five years, starting 2025, with an aim to roughly double the emissions reduction efforts from when Carbon Law was first conceived in 2017. This equates to annual **12%** emission cuts, starting 2025. This rule of thumb can be used as a yardstick, to measure progress for companies, as well as states, organisations and individuals.

## 3. What are the details behind Klimatkollen’s Carbon Law calculations?

Klimatkollen has used  the original method and principles of Carbon Law (2017) and calculated an adjusted carbon emissions reductions trajectory, based on the remaining global carbon budget for staying below 1.5°C.

*Results of Klimatkollen’s calculations*
The table below shows carbon budgets for 50% chance of staying below 1.5, 1.7 and 2°C of global warming. These numbers come from the [Global Carbon Budget 2024](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/17/965/2025/essd-17-965-2025.pdf), and apply from January 2025 to 2050.

| Global warming above pre-industrial levels (°C) | 50% chance carbon budget (GtCO₂) | Reduction rate needed (% per year) |
| ---- | --- | ---  |
| 1.5 | 305 | 11.72 |
| 1.7 |655 | 7.38   |
| 2 | 1,155 | 7.38  |

**Notes**
Our calculations assume residual emissions of 5.5 GtCO₂ in 2050 and are based on a 50% chance of not exceeding 1,5°C. (Source: [All options, not silver bullets, needed to limit global warming to 1.5 °C: a scenario appraisal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abfeec), 2023)

The annual 12% reduction pace does not take into account equity or individual entities' ability to transform their operations, but should be used as a rule of thumb to illustrate the pace needed globally to have a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

## 4. Why recalculate the original Carbon Law?


Klimatkollen’s goal is to create the public pressure needed on decision makers to cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. To this end we publish data and visualizations aimed at a broad public audience, and work with media and partners to raise awareness and spark action. Our mission is to communicate clearly, and show facts as they are.

The public has a right to know what the Paris Agreement and the 1.5°C limit means in practice.

To that end, we were seeking a simple rule of thumb in terms of emission reductions, that companies, states and individuals could start comparing themselves against.

The original Carbon Law has been hugely influential in providing this measuring stick: a halving of emissions every ten years, starting 2030. However, we are now five years behind the original Carbon Law, and running out of carbon budget.

That’s why we recalculated what a trajectory starting 2025 would look like, given emissions are still rising, and the remaining global carbon budget is rapidly shrinking.

## 5. What happens if a company doesn’t meet the 12% a year emissions cuts?

Aiming for 12% emissions cuts annually is an illustration of the step-change in climate action we need to see, if we are to avoid the most disastrous consequences of a rapidly heating planet. However, there are no binding agreements or legal implications for a company that doesn’t keep this pace.

We should do our utmost to get on that trajectory - and cut both carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, as well as simultaneously scaling up solutions and carbon removals. Every fraction of a temperature degree counts, it’s never “too late”, and we aim to show the state of play clearly, whilst encouraging action.

---

## 6. Why is 1.5°C so important, isn’t it already too late?

It’s a code red for humanity. Emissions are still rising, global warming is accelerating, and the remaining carbon budget to keep global warming under 1.5°C – the safe operating space for humanity – is vanishing rapidly.

We are in the race of our lives: to decarbonise our economies, and scale up the solutions. Every tonne emitted counts. And staying below 1.5°C of global warming should be our utmost priority – billions of lives depend on our actions today.

“Go beyond 1.5°C warming, a place our civilisations have never experienced and Earth has not seen in the last 100,000 years, and we will not only see major human and economic damage, but are likely to cross multiple Earth system tipping points, causing amplified warming with billions of people affected.” – [Johan Rockström](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/earth-losing-resilience-does-matter-part-1-risks-we-dont-rockstr%C3%B6m-sigre/?trackingId=aOG3xmhDmTfrtBh85%2FutdQ%3D%3D)

## 7. What is the global carbon budget?

A carbon budget defines the total amount of CO₂ that can be emitted into the atmosphere while still keeping global warming below a certain target, such as 1.5°C. Note that carbon budgets relate to anthropogenic fossil CO₂ emissions only. However, other greenhouse gases have a significant impact on the climate.

There are several different ways to calculate a global carbon budget. Some factors for why different calculations vary include:
- Different temperature scenarios (staying below 1.5, 1.7 or 2°C?)
- The likelihood of staying below that temperature (e.g. 50%, 67% or 83%?)
- The amount of hard-to-abate emissions that could plausibly be addressed by Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)

Klimatkollen has chosen to base our calculation on the IPCC adjusted global carbon budget in the Global Carbon Budget 2024 report, and 50% chance of staying below 1.5° of global warming (above the 1850–1900 level). We are assuming residual emissions of 5.5 GtCO₂ that can be addressed through CDR. The timespan we are looking at is January 2025 to 2050.

## 8. What does an updated Carbon Law mean for companies?

Companies can use Klimatkollen’s visualisations to see how close – or far – they are from being in line with the global emissions trajectory needed for keeping global warming below 1.5°C.

Of course, most companies will compare their climate action with their own base year, and map progress against this point in time. The Klimatkollen visualisations of Carbon Law will be a complement and a yard stick that is the same for all companies, no matter their starting point, sector, or operational structure.

Cutting emissions by 12% a year is hard, especially when it comes to emissions stemming from a company’s value chain (so-called scope 3 emissions).

Some companies would have done a lot already to cut emissions and will therefore have a harder journey to reduce emissions at the pace needed starting 2025.

Some companies’ core business is in providing solutions, for instance in solar, wind or energy efficiency. It can be argued that the emissions of these companies need to increase to push out fossil-based alternatives.

## What about other greenhouse gases?

No, other greenhouse gases are not included in the global carbon budget that we base our calculations on, because they behave differently in the Earth systems (read more here), eg. diffuse much faster, whereas carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. However, it’s very important that actions are taken to quickly achieve long-lasting and deep cuts across other gases too.
