**Klimatkollen is changing its method for calculating emissions data for Sweden's municipalities. Previously, so called carbon budgets were used. Klimatkollen is now switching to the global rule of thumb, ‘Carbon Law’, which stipulates a 12 per cent reduction per year in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. Carbon Law was presented in 2017 by Johan Rockström, Owen Gaffney and Johan Falk as a scientifically based path to achieving the Paris Agreement. The calculations were updated by Klimatkollen in June 2025.**  

*"Our new calculation of how quickly emissions need to be reduced in order to be in line with the Paris Agreement and 1.5 degrees gives us a rule of thumb that can be applied to municipalities, companies and organisations. The important thing for the climate is how quickly emissions are reduced in the near future. A general rule of thumb of a 12 per cent reduction per year makes it easier for citizens to know what is required and to hold decision-makers accountable"*, says Frida Berry Eklund, co-founder of Klimatkollen. 

Klimatkollen is making three methodological changes:

1. **Carbon budgets become Carbon Law.** Individual carbon budgets are removed and instead municipalities' estimated future emissions are compared with a general reduction rate of 12 per cent per year, which means a halving of emissions every five years from 2025 onwards.

2. **Fossil carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) are being expanded to include more greenhouse gas emissions (CO2e).** Previously, Klimatkollen showed carbon dioxide emissions in municipalities. Now we are also adding data on other greenhouse gases, such as methane emissions from agriculture. The data comes from the same source, namely the National Emissions Database run by SMHI.

3. **The trend line is being reweighted.** Our forecast for future emissions gives less weight to individual extreme values, such as the start-up or closure of a major industrial emitter in the municipality. This provides a more accurate and realistic picture of the trend for future emissions.

The change in methodology means that the total number of tonnes reported on Klimatkollen for the country's municipalities will increase, as more greenhouse gases are included, not just fossil carbon dioxide.

In terms of how emissions need to be reduced under the Paris Agreement, the reduction curve for most municipalities will be gentler than before, when it was based on the municipality's carbon dioxide budget. This is partly because the carbon dioxide budget included a fairness principle that gave Sweden a very small remaining national carbon dioxide budget. The transition to Carbon Law means a ‘same for all’ principle, i.e. a 12 per cent reduction per year for countries, municipalities and companies.
