Klimatkollen is about making complex climate data accessible and understandable for everyone. We know that transparency about emissions is crucial for driving the climate transition – and for citizens, employees, and investors to be able to demand accountability.

## Our Sources – The Foundation of Reliability

All data you see at Klimatkollen has a clear purpose. We base our information on official statistics and open sources. For example, emission data for Sweden's municipalities comes from the National Emission Database (SMHI) and data on corporate emissions from the companies' own sustainability and annual reports.

## From Raw Data to Meaningful Visualisation

However, raw data is rarely directly useful or understandable for an ordinary person – it needs to be put into context. Our work involves processing and visualising climate data so that it tells a clear story:

- **Consistency:** We standardise all emission figures to carbon dioxide equivalents (CO₂e) to enable comparisons between different sectors and actors.  
- **Contextualisation:** We often present data in several ways, for example, both as total emissions and as emissions per capita. This provides important context for understanding both the absolute volume and the individual impact.  
- **Trends and Targets:** Our graphs show historical trends and the development in relation to the Paris Agreement. In this way, we highlight where progress is being made and where efforts need to increase.

## A Key Graph – Three Questions That Require Answers

For both municipalities and companies, we display a key emissions graph. Our goal is to give citizens insight into three things:

### How has it gone so far?

The graph below shows Volvo Cars' reported greenhouse gas emissions. They have reported emissions since 2018 but choose the base year 2019, which is the year they measure themselves against. Total reported emissions in 2019 were [45 million tonnes of CO2e](https://klimatkollen.se/sv/companies/Q215293) (in their own operations, from purchased energy, and in the value chain from suppliers and product use). For comparison, Sweden's total territorial emissions the same year were [50 million tonnes of CO2e](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/data-och-statistik/klimat/sveriges-utslapp-och-upptag-av-vaxthusgaser/). By looking back in time, we get an idea of whether emissions appear to be increasing, decreasing, or flatlining. Here we look for a clear trend, not individual dips, such as during the pandemic in 2020. Large rapid shifts are often due to major changes in operations or the economy. Since the companies' reports are a look back at the previous year, there is a gap between the latest reported year and today. We show this gap with a dashed line.

### What will happen if we continue as before?

Then we look ahead and make an assessment of how emissions may develop in the coming years based on the trend so far. Klimatkollen uses the statistical model LAD (Least Absolute Deviation). Simply put, LAD clips peaks and troughs, making the trend line less sensitive to extreme values in individual years. The trend line is the red dashed line.

We can look at Volvo Cars' forecast up to 2030, where the graph looks like this:

Or we can click all the way to 2050 – the Paris Agreement's reference year. Then the entire graph for Volvo Cars looks like this:

### How should it go according to the Paris Agreement?

The green line shows how quickly emissions need to decrease to "be in line with the Paris Agreement." There is often a gap between the trend line and the Paris line. But what does that mean? Well, at a global level, beyond a certain volume of emissions, we risk exceeding 1.5 degrees of warming. This is called a [global carbon budget](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/17/965/2025/essd-17-965-2025.html). From this budget, we can calculate backwards to see how quickly emissions must decrease, from today onwards. In 2017, Johan Rockström, Johan Falk, and Owen Gaffney developed a rule of thumb for emission reductions called the [Carbon Law](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2017-03-23-curbing-emissions-with-a-new-carbon-law.html). It said that, from 2020, global emissions needed to be halved every ten years, which corresponds to a rate of 7 per cent reduction per year. Unfortunately, that has not happened. On the contrary, global emissions have continued to increase, which means a rapidly shrinking global carbon budget to stay within 1.5 degrees. So what does the global rule of thumb look like today, in 2025? We have calculated this in our white paper [here](https://klimatkollen.se/reports/2025-06-19_ApplyingCarbonLawFrom2025.pdf). Now, we must instead halve emissions every five years. This corresponds to an annual reduction of 12 per cent per year. Read more about our calculation in this [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/win-race-against-climate-disaster-we-need-halve-emissions-over-next-five-years-2025-07-08/).

When we assess whether a company or municipality is in line with the Paris Agreement, we look at the amount of greenhouse gases that risk being emitted if they continue according to the current trend. We then look at how this differs from the remaining emission budget according to the Carbon Law, i.e., the space under the green line. If the number of tonnes is greater than the Carbon Law space, the company/municipality is not in line with the Paris Agreement. Volvo Cars' trend line indicates a total of 1,266.66 million tonnes of emissions (if they do not accelerate emission reductions), which is 926,644,638 tonnes more than what is available in their emission budget. So, if Volvo Cars' emissions continue as they are today, they will not meet the Paris Agreement.

For the climate, how much is emitted in the near future matters greatly because earlier emissions remain and accumulate in the atmosphere for a long time to come.

### Three Things to Note.

1. No, an individual municipality or company is not bound to reduce emissions in line with the Carbon Law. But the rule of thumb gives a good idea of how quickly everyone – the world as a whole, countries, companies, and municipalities – needs to eliminate emissions.  
2. In the graph, we show greenhouse gas emissions, meaning not just carbon dioxide. However, emissions of other greenhouse gases, such as methane, also need to drop towards zero.  
3. The Carbon Law is the same for everyone. This means that this method does not take into account one of the Paris Agreement's key formulations: that countries with the greatest capacity and historical responsibility should lead the way.

## How Can I Use the Key Graph?

The key graph provides good clues as to how emissions are progressing – and how they should be progressing. But it does not explain why emissions are increasing, decreasing, or standing still. Here you, as a citizen, can ask questions of the company you work for or the municipality where you live: What are you doing to reduce emissions? And – do you know if the measures are enough to reach the targets?

## Your Guide to Our Method

The details of our method – how we handle gaps, make supplements, and choose visualisations – are described in our [Sources and Methods page](https://klimatkollen.se/sv/methodology?view=general), for those who want to fully understand the figures behind the graphs.

We are constantly looking to improve our data quality and presentation. Do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions or comments.
