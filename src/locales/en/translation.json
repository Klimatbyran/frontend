      "paragraph2": "We provide a clear picture of how emissions are progressing compared to where they need to be. By making this information accessible, we empower the public, contribute to fact-based discussions, and strengthen support for climate action.",
      "paragraph3": "Our vision is for decision-makers in politics and business to be guided by an informed and engaged public, leading to actions that reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.",
      "paragraph4": "Launched in March 2022, Klimatkollen is operated by the non-profit association Klimatbyrån. It was founded by Ola Spännar and Frida Berry Eklund. Initially focused on local climate data for Swedish municipalities, the platform expanded in 2024 to include corporate climate data."

      "paragraph4": "Klimatkollen complements the public sector. Authorities can – and should – only publish carefully processed data. This has many advantages. At the same time, the process can be slow, and correcting errors can take time.",
      "paragraph5": "We want to be faster. Wikipedia is updated daily by civil society. Klimatkollen works in the same spirit.",

        "paragraph2": "To meet this target, global greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels) and reduced to near-zero by 2050. However, emissions are <0>still increasing</0> worldwide.",
        "paragraph3": "Under the Paris Agreement, wealthier nations must take greater responsibility, as their historically high emissions mean they have already used a significant share of the remaining carbon budget needed to limit global warming. Sweden is among these countries and should lead the way in reducing emissions while also supporting more vulnerable nations in their transition.",

The original carbon law stated that emissions needed to be reduced by 7% per year starting in 2020, in other words, halving emissions every decade. It is based on the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C, with a target of 1.5°C and the carbon budgets identified by the IPCC.",
        "paragraph2": "We use a revised version of the original Carbon Law to display a needed trajectory line on each company's or municipality's historic data graphs. This line shows the required emissions reduction for the company or municipality to stay in line with the Paris Agreement.",
        "paragraph3": "A revised Carbon Law is necessary due to failure to meet the original carbon law's targets to reduce emissions by 7% per year starting in 2020. Taking into account the carbon budget as it now stands, a steeper trajectory is needed to meet the Paris Agreement's goal. The new rule of thumb is that emissions need to be reduced by 12% per year starting in 2025.",
        "paragraph4": "Using the Carbon Law, we show the required emissions-reduction pathway on each company’s or municipality’s emissions-development graph. This “Paris Line” illustrates how much they need to reduce their emissions to align with the Paris Agreement.",
