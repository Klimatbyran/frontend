        "paragraph1": "The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty between the world's nations, aimed at limiting global warming to well below 2°C, with a target of 1.5°C.",
        "paragraph2": "To meet this target, global greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels) and reduced to near-zero by 2050. However, emissions are <0>still increasing</0> worldwide.",
        "paragraph3": "Under the Paris Agreement, wealthier nations must take greater responsibility, as their historically high emissions mean they have already used a significant share of the remaining carbon budget needed to limit global warming. Sweden is among these countries and should lead the way in reducing emissions while also supporting more vulnerable nations in their transition.",

      "co2Budgets": {
        "title": "Carbon Budgets",
        "description": "Understand how carbon budgets are calculated and allocated",
        "paragraph1": "A carbon budget represents the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted before atmospheric CO₂ levels rise high enough to exceed the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C target.",
        "paragraph2": "According to a <0>calculation</0> by researchers at Uppsala University and the Tyndall Centre in the UK, as of 2024, approximately 340 gigatonnes of CO₂ remain globally for a 50% chance of keeping temperature rise below 1.5°C. At the current rate of emissions, this global budget will be depleted in about eight years.",
        "paragraph3": "Using this global budget, the researchers have also estimated Sweden's national carbon budget for a fair climate transition.",
        "paragraph4": "Their calculations show that, from January 2024, Sweden has a national carbon allowance of 80 million tonnes to stay on track for the 1.5°C target. For an 83% chance of keeping warming below 2°C, the budget increases to 285 million tonnes. By comparison, Sweden's total greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 were 45.2 million tonnes.",
        "paragraph5": "At Sweden's current rate of emissions, the 1.5°C carbon budget will be used up in 1.8 years, while the 2°C budget will last 6.4 years. To stay within the 1.5°C target, Sweden must cut emissions by at least 35% per year starting in 2024. If aiming for the 2°C target, annual reductions of at least 13.5% are needed.",
        "paragraph6": "Klimatkollen has allocated the new national carbon budget (80 million tonnes, including emissions from international aviation and shipping) to Sweden's municipalities, using the same method that was applied to break down the global budget nationally.",
        "paragraph7": "These local carbon budgets enable comparisons between actual emissions and the reductions needed. Klimatkollen presents carbon budgets for municipalities both as numerical values and as development curves, illustrating the necessary decline in emissions to stay in line with the Paris Agreement.",
        "paragraph8": "In addition to the Tyndall model used by Klimatkollen, there are other approaches to calculating a national carbon budget. For example, see Chalmers <0>here</0>."
      },
      "carbonLaw": {
        "title": "Carbon Law",
        "description": "Understand how Klimatkollen applies Carbon Law to company and municipality data",
        "paragraph1": "Carbon Law helps companies and governments to have a target for reducing their carbon emissions; it's a rule of thumb all entities of any size can use (world, country, company, municipality, individual, etc.). The original carbon law stated that emissions needed to be reduced by 7% per year starting in 2020, in other words, halving emissions every decade. It is based on the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C, with a target of 1.5°C and the carbon budgets identified by the IPCC.",
        "paragraph2": "We use a revised version of the original Carbon Law to display a needed trajectory line on each company's or municipality's historic data graphs. This line shows the required emissions reduction for the company or municipality to stay in line with the Paris Agreement.",
        "paragraph3": "A revised Carbon Law is necessary due to failure to meet the original carbon law's targets to reduce emissions by 7% per year starting in 2020. Taking into account the carbon budget as it now stands, a steeper trajectory is needed to meet the Paris Agreement's goal. The new rule of thumb is that emissions need to be reduced by 12% per year starting in 2025.",

        "title": "Different Types of Emissions",
        "description": "Learn about the various types of emissions and how they are measured",
        "paragraph1": "Klimatkollen is an independent fact-based platform that follows established standards for emissions reporting. The climate data we present reflects the boundaries and assumptions used in carbon budget calculations. For example, carbon budgets cannot be directly linked to all greenhouse gas emissions, as other gases like methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapour are also included in overall climate impact assessments.",
        "paragraph2": "Emissions from cement production are excluded from the IPCC's global carbon budget and, as a result, are also omitted from Sweden's carbon budget and emissions data. This specifically affects the municipalities of Gotland, Skövde, and Mörbylånga, where cement production is currently or has previously taken place.",
        "paragraph3": "Sweden also has a significant climate impact from goods imported from other countries, leading to emissions abroad. These consumption-based emissions are not included in the carbon budget.",
        "paragraph4": "Similarly, emissions from forests and land (known as biogenic emissions) are also excluded from the carbon budget.",
        "paragraph5": "In reality, climate-impacting emissions are much higher than the territorial fossil carbon emissions typically reported by authorities and the media. The data currently displayed on Klimatkollen reflects these territorial emissions.",
        "paragraph6": "Klimatkollen is actively exploring how to incorporate other greenhouse gas emissions on the website in the future, while maintaining the ability to compare current emissions with carbon budgets."
