Local climate efforts build up to national change.\n\n**Ways to Get Involved:**\n- Klimatklivet – a government-supported investment fund helping municipalities, organizations, and businesses reduce greenhouse gases through local projects (e.g. cycling infrastructure, biogas, heat recovery). Funds are always disbursed through your regional County Administrative Board. ([https://www.naturvardsverket.se/amnesomraden/klimatomstallningen/klimatklivet/](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/amnesomraden/klimatomstallningen/klimatklivet/))\n- County Administrative Board’s advisory services – each county (Länsstyrelse) offers support, webinars and guidance for local climate work and for crowdfunding regional climate projects. ([https://www.lansstyrelsen.se/blekinge.html](https://www.lansstyrelsen.se/blekinge.html))\n- Local citizen proposals (medborgarförslag) – many Swedish municipalities allow residents to propose environmental initiatives (like expanding public transport or urban gardens) via their municipal website or council.

Once the budget runs out, any additional emissions make it increasingly likely that this temperature threshold will be exceeded.\n\nThere’s no “hard stop” or automatic consequence on the day the budget runs out — but every tonne emitted after that pushes us further from climate safety. The budget is like a climate speed limit: it’s technically possible to go over, but doing so increases the risks of heatwaves, biodiversity loss, water stress, and tipping points.\n\nThat’s why reducing emissions quickly — before the budget expires — is so important. Every year of delay increases the pace of cuts that will be needed later.\n\n**Why does the local budget matter?**\nSweden’s national carbon budget is divided across all municipalities based on their past emissions. That means each municipality has its own share of responsibility. If one area overshoots its budget, it puts more pressure on others to cut faster — or increases national overshoot.\n\nLocal action isn’t just symbolic — it’s mathematically real. The more each municipality stays within its share, the more likely Sweden (and the world) can stay within safe climate boundaries.\n\n**It’s not about perfection, but direction.** Going over the budget doesn’t mean it’s too late — but it does mean deeper, faster changes will be needed to stay within safer climate limits."

      "This number shows the **percentage change in total reported emissions** compared to the previous year. It helps highlight whether a company’s climate impact was **increasing or decreasing between two years**.\n\n**Note:** Large changes from one year to the next can sometimes reflect more than just actual emissions trends. For example, emissions can jump or drop if:\n\n- The company **starts or stops reporting certain scopes or categories**\n- There’s a **merger, acquisition, or major restructuring**\n- Reporting methods or boundaries change\n\nAlways consider the context when interpreting large percentage changes.\n\nThe year-over-year number, however, **only shows the change between the selected year and the previous year**, and is not necessarily aligned with the company’s own climate targets or tracking.\n\n**Most companies track their climate progress based on a selected “base year”** (such as 2019 or 2020), and measure reductions from that starting point."
