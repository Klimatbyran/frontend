# What is turnover, and why does it matter for emissions?

**Turnover** refers to the total revenue or income a company generates from its business activities — in other words, how much money it brings in before costs are deducted.

For example, a company with a turnover of £500 million has earned that amount in sales over the course of a year.

Turnover helps put a company’s **emissions into perspective**. By comparing emissions to turnover, we can see how much climate impact is generated **per unit of economic activity**.

This is often referred to as **emissions intensity**, and it can help answer questions like:

- Is the company growing its business while reducing its emissions?
- How efficient is the company in terms of emissions per £1 million earned?

Two companies might emit the same amount of greenhouse gases, but if one has five times the turnover, it may be operating more efficiently — or have more resources to invest in reductions.

Turnover doesn’t explain everything, but it’s a useful indicator when comparing companies of different sizes or evaluating progress over time.
