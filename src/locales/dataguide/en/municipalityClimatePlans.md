# What are climate plans?

A climate plan outlines how the municipality aims to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change.

An adopted plan means there’s a political and strategic commitment — but its strength depends on its goals, funding, and how well it’s followed through.

**Things residents can check:**

- Is the plan aligned with the Paris Agreement or Sweden’s national targets?
- Are there specific goals for transport, housing, food, or procurement?
- Can citizens participate in shaping future updates?
