# What’s the difference between local and consumption emissions?

There are two common ways to measure climate emissions for a municipality:

1. **Local emissions (Territorial emissions)**

These are the emissions that physically happen within the municipality’s borders.

They include things like:

- Cars driving on local roads
- Heating homes and buildings
- Factories or industries operating in the area
- Agricultural activity (e.g. livestock or fertilizers)

*Think of these as “what happens here”.*

This is the type of data usually reported to national and international climate systems, and it’s used to calculate carbon budgets.

2. **Consumption-based emissions**

These include everything consumed by people who live in the municipality — no matter where in the world those emissions actually happened.

They include emissions from:

- Imported food, clothing, and electronics
- Flights taken by residents
- Digital services or online shopping
- Construction materials used in buildings

*Think of these as “what we cause as consumers, no matter where it happens”.*

**Why both matter:**

- **Local emissions** help track what a municipality can control directly — like urban planning, heating systems, and public transit.
- **Consumption emissions** reflect the full climate footprint of people’s lifestyles — even when the pollution happens far away.

By looking at both, we get a clearer and more honest picture of climate impact — and where action is needed.
