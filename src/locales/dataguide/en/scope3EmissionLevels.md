# Why are Scope 3 emissions often so much higher?

Scope 3 emissions cover **all the indirect greenhouse gas emissions that occur outside a company’s own operations** — such as those from its supply chain, product use, business travel, waste, and more.

Because Scope 3 includes so many different activities — from how raw materials are produced to how customers use and dispose of products — it usually represents the **largest share of a company’s total climate impact**.

Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which are mostly under a company’s direct control (e.g. fuel used on-site or electricity purchased), Scope 3 emissions happen **outside the company’s walls**. This makes them more complex to measure, because:

- Companies often rely on **data from suppliers, partners, or customers**, which may not always be available or accurate
- Emissions can vary greatly depending on **how and where products are made, used, and disposed of**
- Some categories, like employee commuting or the full lifecycle of a product, involve many assumptions and estimations

Despite these challenges, tracking Scope 3 is essential for understanding a company’s full climate footprint — and for identifying the biggest opportunities for real emissions reductions.
