# Electric Car share

This shows how much the share of electric cars has grown in the area.

It’s a sign of both resident demand and supportive infrastructure — like charging stations and incentives.

What to look for locally:

- Can you find charging points easily?
- Does your municipality support shared electric mobility?
- Is public transport also improving?
