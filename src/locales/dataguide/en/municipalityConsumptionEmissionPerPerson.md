# What does consumption emissions per person mean?

This number shows the average emissions caused by consumption in the municipality — including food, travel, housing, and goods — divided per resident. The national average is 5.5 tonnes per person. Added to this is each citizen's share of emissions from public consumption and investment, another 3.7 tonnes per person.

For comparison:

- Global average: ~4.7 tons per person per year
- Swedish average: ~9 tons per person per year

It’s a useful way to understand how daily life and consumption affect emissions.
