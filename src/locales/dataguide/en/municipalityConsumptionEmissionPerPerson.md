This number shows the average emissions caused by consumption in the municipality — including food, travel, housing, and goods — divided per resident.

For comparison:

- Global average: ~4.7 tons per person per year
- Swedish average: ~8 tons per person per year

It’s a useful way to understand how daily life and consumption affect emissions.
