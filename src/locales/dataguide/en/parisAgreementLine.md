# What is the Paris Agreement line on the graph?

The green line represents the emissions trajectory aligned with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C target. It shows the pace at which emissions must fall globally in order to stay within the remaining carbon budget — a 12% annual reduction starting in 2025. This updated trajectory reflects the reality that global emissions didn’t peak in 2020, and that we are now five years behind the original Carbon Law pathway. Klimatkollen uses this revised Carbon Law rule of thumb to visualise how far companies and municipalities are from the needed emissions path.
