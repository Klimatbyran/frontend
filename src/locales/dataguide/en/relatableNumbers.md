# Why relatable numbers?

Emission numbers are often large and difficult to grasp, so we’ve translated changes in emissions over time into more relatable terms. This helps illustrate how much an increase or decrease in emissions really means in practice.

Rather than comparing total emissions, we focus on the change in emissions — for example, how much a company or region’s emissions have gone up or down compared to the previous year. This approach highlights real-world progress or setbacks in reducing emissions.
