# Why relatable numbers?

Emission numbers can be difficult to grasp in isolation. To make them easier to understand, we convert changes over time into relatable, real-world equivalents. This helps show what an increase or decrease in emissions actually means in practice.

Rather than comparing total emissions, we focus on the change — for example, how much a company or region’s emissions have gone up or down compared to the previous year.
