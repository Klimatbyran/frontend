# Why relatable numbers?

Emission numbers can be difficult to grasp, so we’ve translated changes in emissions over time into more relatable terms. This helps illustrate how much an increase or decrease in emissions really means.

Rather than comparing total emissions, we focus on the change — for example, how much a company or region’s emissions have gone up or down compared to the previous year.
