# What is Scope 2

**Scope 2 – Indirect energy emissions**

Scope 2 covers emissions from the **electricity and energy** the company **buys and uses**, even though the pollution happens at the power plant, not on-site.

For example:
- Electricity used to power offices, stores, or factories
- Heating or cooling purchased from an external provider

The company doesn’t create these emissions directly, but they’re still responsible for choosing and using that energy.
