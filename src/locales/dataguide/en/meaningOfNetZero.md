# What does “net-zero” actually mean?

Net-zero means a company aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and then **balance out the remaining emissions** by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere — often through carbon removal, tree planting, or offsetting.

This concept is central to the **Paris Agreement**, which calls on countries (and companies) to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century in order to limit global warming to **1.5°C** above pre-industrial levels.

To be credible, net-zero plans should focus on **deep, long-term emission reductions** — not just relying on offsets.

In short: true net-zero means cutting emissions at the source first, then carefully addressing what’s left.
