# Understanding company sectors

Companies are grouped into sectors based on what they do, using the **Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)**. This system helps organize companies into consistent categories — such as energy, finance, consumer goods, or technology — making it easier to compare businesses with similar operations.

**Why it matters:** Different industries have very different emissions profiles and challenges.

For example:

- A **utility company** may naturally have high emissions due to energy production
- A **tech company** might have lower direct emissions but still face pressure to reduce supply chain (Scope 3) impacts

Comparing companies within the **same sector** helps provide more meaningful insights into climate performance and progress.
