# Financed Emissions Reporting

Financed emissions are often reported with a delay, as they are often based on the previous year's data from the companies included in the investment. We show emissions data in scope 3 category 15 in the year it is publicly reported in the annual report, even if it is sometimes stated that the data in this category comes from a previous year.

This means that when you see scope 3 category 15 emissions for a financial company, the actual emissions may have occurred in an earlier year than what's shown in the reporting year. This is common practice in the financial sector due to the time it takes to collect and verify emissions data from portfolio companies.
