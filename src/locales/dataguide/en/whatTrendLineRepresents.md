# What the Trend Line Represents and How We Use It

The trend line shows how emissions might develop in the future if the recent pattern continues. It is not a forecast of planned actions, but a simple way to understand long-term direction.

**What the trend line represents**

The trend line answers the question:

> “If emissions continue changing as they have in recent years, what might future emissions look like?”

It smooths out year-to-year fluctuations and provides a clear view of whether emissions are generally rising, stable, or falling.

**What the trend line does *not* represent**

- It is **not** a prediction of future policy or investments.  
- It is **not** a required pathway or target.  
- It is **not** a % reduction model.  
- It is **not** guaranteed to match the Paris Path.

It reflects only the **historical trend**.

**How we use the trend line**

We use the trend line to:
- show the direction and pace of change,
- estimate future emissions year by year,  
- calculate the **total projected emissions** from 2025–2050,  
- and compare that total to the Paris-aligned carbon budget.
