# Why relate to forest fires?

To put the emissions change into a concrete context, we calculate how much land would need to burn to produce the same amount of emissions. We base this on the following data:

- On average, each hectare of forest contains about 50 tons of carbon (C). (1)
- Carbon is converted to carbon dioxide (CO₂) using the factor 44/12 (molecular weights), which means that one hectare corresponds to roughly 50 × (44/12) ≈ 183 tons of CO₂.

Based on the emissions change, we calculate how many hectares would be required to match that amount of CO₂. This area is then compared to familiar references such as football fields, tennis courts, or city areas, providing the user with an intuitive sense of scale. Using this method, we can express it as something like: “This emission corresponds to X football fields burning.” In this way, otherwise abstract numbers become more concrete and relatable.
