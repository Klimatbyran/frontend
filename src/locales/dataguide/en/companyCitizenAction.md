# What can I do with this knowledge as a citizen, consumer, investor, or employee?

You can use this data to:

- Demand measures that decreases emissions more and faster
- Support companies that report transparently and act on climate
- Ask critical questions about gaps or inconsistencies
- Choose products or services aligned with low-impact sectors
- Advocate for stronger targets and reporting in your workplace or portfolio
- Support local and national policy towards industry that improves transparency requirements and follow-through on targets and emissions reduction goals

Climate-literate consumers and stakeholders help push companies to improve â€” and transparency is a powerful first step.
