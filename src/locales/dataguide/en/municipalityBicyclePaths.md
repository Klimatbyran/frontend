# Bicycle Paths

This number shows how many metres of bike path exist for each resident. It gives a general sense of how much dedicated cycling infrastructure a municipality provides.

A **higher number** usually indicates stronger support for safe, accessible cycling — which can reduce emissions from car trips, improve health, and cut traffic congestion.

**Why invest in bike infrastructure?**

- Reduces car dependence, especially for short trips (under 5 km)
- Cuts local air pollution and traffic noise
- Improves health outcomes by encouraging active mobility
- Offers a low-cost, inclusive transport option for youth and people without cars
- Helps meet local emissions targets in a cost-effective way

Municipalities that invest in safe, connected bike paths often pair them with policies like bike parking at transit hubs, repair stations, and winter plowing of bike lanes.

**Why might a municipality have less cycling infrastructure?**

Not every area will prioritise bike lanes — and that’s not always a sign of neglect.

Some common reasons:

- Rural geography: Homes and services are spread out, making biking impractical for daily use
- Severe winters: Harsh climate or icy roads may limit year-round cycling
- Budget priorities: Resources may be focused on public transport, road maintenance, or other pressing infrastructure
- Existing road network: Legacy infrastructure may not easily support bike lane additions without major upgrades

Even in rural areas, though, safe routes to schools and community centres can still make cycling safer and more appealing.
