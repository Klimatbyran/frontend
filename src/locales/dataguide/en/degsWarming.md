# Why use the TCRE framework?

The **Transient Climate Response to Cumulative Emissions (TCRE)** is a scientifically proven framework that shows a direct, linear relationship between the total amount of CO₂ emitted and the resulting global temperature increase. It allows us to calculate exactly how much a company's cumulative emissions contribute to global warming in milli-degrees Celsius (m°C).

## How it shows a company's contribution

By using the TCRE formula, we can take a company's total historical emissions (e.g., your 1.61 GtCO₂) and convert them directly into a temperature value (e.g., 0.72 m°C).

- **It creates accountability:** It moves the conversation from "tons of gas" (which is hard to visualize) to "degrees of warming".
- **It's a permanent record:** Since CO₂ emissions stay in the atmosphere for centuries, the TCRE represents a company's "permanent footprint" on the Earth's thermostat.

## Cumulative vs. annual

This graph shows **cumulative** data. Unlike annual targets, cumulative emissions never go down unless carbon is physically removed from the atmosphere.

## Milli-degrees (m°C)

While 0.7 m°C might sound small for one company (like ABB), there are thousands of large companies. When added together, these "milli-degrees" create the 1.5°C to 2.0°C total global warming.
