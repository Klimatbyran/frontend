# Estimating the Human Impact of Carbon Emissions

It is possible to estimate the potential human impacts associated with additional greenhouse gas emissions. A 2021 peer-reviewed study published in *Nature Communications* examined the relationship between cumulative carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions and temperature-related mortality.

The study estimates that for every **4,434 metric tonnes of CO₂** added to the atmosphere, **one excess death** may occur globally between 2020 and 2100 as a result of temperature-related impacts.

## What is an "excess death"?

An **excess death** refers to a death that would not have occurred in the absence of additional warming. In this context, it primarily relates to increased mortality from heat exposure and heatwaves in a warmer climate, compared to a counterfactual scenario in which global temperatures remained lower.

These are not immediate deaths caused directly by a single emission source. Rather, they are statistical estimates of additional mortality risk over time due to cumulative warming.

## Expressed at a larger scale

- **1 million tonnes (1 MtCO₂)** ≈ **226 future excess deaths**

## Interpreting these numbers

This relationship provides a way to approximate the long-term human cost associated with emissions at different scales — whether individual, municipal, national, or corporate.

These figures are model-based estimates and depend on assumptions about future warming, adaptation, population changes, and vulnerability. They should not be interpreted as precise predictions. However, they offer a quantitative indicator of the broader social impact of emissions, helping to translate abstract carbon quantities into human consequences over time.
