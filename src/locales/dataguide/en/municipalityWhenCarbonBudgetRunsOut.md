# What happens after the carbon budget runs out?

The carbon budget is a finite amount of emissions we can release if we want at least a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C. Once the budget runs out, any additional emissions make it increasingly likely that this temperature threshold will be exceeded.

There’s no “hard stop” or automatic consequence on the day the budget runs out — but every tonne emitted after that pushes us further from climate safety. The budget is like a climate speed limit: it’s technically possible to go over, but doing so increases the risks of heatwaves, biodiversity loss, water stress, and tipping points.

That’s why reducing emissions quickly — before the budget expires — is so important. Every year of delay increases the pace of cuts that will be needed later.

**Why does the local budget matter?**
Sweden’s national carbon budget is divided across all municipalities based on their past emissions. That means each municipality has its own share of responsibility. If one area overshoots its budget, it puts more pressure on others to cut faster — or increases national overshoot.

Local action isn’t just symbolic — it’s mathematically real. The more each municipality stays within its share, the more likely Sweden (and the world) can stay within safe climate boundaries.

**It’s not about perfection, but direction.** Going over the budget doesn’t mean it’s too late — but it does mean deeper, faster changes will be needed to stay within safer climate limits.
