# How can I tell if a company is making real progress on climate?

Look for:

- Clear emissions reduction over multiple years (especially in Scope 3)
- A consistent and disclosed **base year**
- Sector-specific targets that align with 1.5°C pathways
- Transparent and consistent reporting across all three scopes

Reductions that follow a clear trend — not just one-off drops — and full Scope 3 reporting are strong signs of serious climate action.
