# How We Calculate the Trend Line

The trend line shows how emissions are likely to change in the future if the organisation continues along the same pattern as it has in recent years. It is not a forecast of planned actions, but a simple statistical estimate based on historical data.

## We use a method called Least Absolute Deviations (LAD)

To calculate the trend, we use a statistical technique called **Least Absolute Deviations (LAD)**.  
This method draws a straight line through the historical emissions values by finding the line that keeps the total distance to the data points as small as possible.

Unlike a percentage-based trend, LAD produces a **linear change in tonnes per year**, not a percentage.

LAD is chosen because it is:
- **robust** against outliers,
- **simple and transparent**, and  
- produces a clear trend even when data fluctuates

## Why it is linear
Because LAD fits a **straight line**, the model assumes that emissions change by the **same number of tonnes each year**.  
For example, it might show a decrease of –1,500 tonnes per year.

This also means that the **percentage change** will vary over time:
- the same tonne reduction is a small % when emissions are high
- and a large % when emissions are low

This is why the trend line does **not** represent a fixed annual percentage, but a consistent annual change in tonnes.
