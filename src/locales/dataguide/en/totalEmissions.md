# What our total emissions represent

This figure represents the **total reported greenhouse gas (GHG)** emissions for the company in a given year. It includes emissions from **Scope 1, 2, and 3** — offering a broad view of the company’s climate impact across its operations and value chain.

**Note:** Biogenic emissions (e.g. from plant-based materials) are **not included** in this total.

Companies report their emissions in three categories **— Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 —** to clarify **where emissions come from** and **how responsibility is assigned**.
