# What is Scope 1

**Scope 1 – Direct emissions**

These are emissions that come **directly from activities the company controls.**

Think of things like:

- Fuel burned in company vehicles
- Emissions from boilers or furnaces in company buildings
- Any manufacturing processes that release greenhouse gases

If the company owns it and it burns fuel or releases emissions on-site, it’s Scope 1.
