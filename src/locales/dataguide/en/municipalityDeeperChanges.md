# What do “deeper changes” look like at the municipal level?

When we talk about deeper or faster changes, we mean moving beyond small adjustments and into system-level shifts that reduce emissions significantly and quickly. For municipalities, that can include:

- **Urban planning** that prioritises walking, cycling, and public transport instead of car dependency
- **Investments in energy-efficient buildings**, heating systems (like district heating or geothermal), and renovations
- **Shifting procurement and food policy** toward plant-based meals, local suppliers, and low-emission logistics
- **Electrifying transport fleets**, including municipal service vehicles, buses, and charging infrastructure
- **Phasing out fossil fuel use** in industries and supporting clean technology development locally
- **Protecting green spaces** and enabling climate adaptation and carbon sinks (like wetland restoration)

Deeper changes require collaboration between political leaders, public servants, businesses, and residents — but they also unlock long-term health, economic, and resilience benefits.
