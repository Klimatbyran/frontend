# Predicted Date for Net Zero Emissions

This is the year when the municipality’s emissions are expected to reach net zero — according to its current emissions trend.

**Note:** this is not a policy target, but a mathematical projection.

Net zero means the municipality’s emissions reach zero, without counting carbon offsets. It’s based on current trends — not on climate policies or future plans.
