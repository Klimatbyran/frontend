# Predicted Date for Net Zero Emissions

This is the year when the municipality’s emissions are expected to reach net zero — according to its current emissions trend.

**Note:** this is not a policy target, but a mathematical projection.

Net zero means reaching an a point of minimal emissions that can be offset, with various carbon capture methods, to be effectively zero. It’s based on current trends — not on climate policies or future plans.
