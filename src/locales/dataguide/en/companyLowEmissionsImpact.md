# Can a company have low emissions but still be harmful to the climate?

Yes. A company might show low emissions if it outsources its most polluting activities, reports only partial Scope 3 data, or operates in a low-emitting sector. But it could still be enabling large emissions — for example, through its investments, supply chain choices, or by selling high-impact products.

Looking only at reported emissions can miss this wider influence — especially if Scope 3 is limited or excluded.
