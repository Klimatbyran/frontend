# What the year-over-year change shows

This number shows the **percentage change in total reported emissions** compared to the previous year. It helps highlight whether a company’s climate impact was **increasing or decreasing between two years**.

**Note:** Large changes from one year to the next can sometimes reflect more than just actual emissions trends. For example, emissions can jump or drop if:

- The company **starts or stops reporting certain scopes or categories**
- There’s a **merger, acquisition, or major restructuring**
- Reporting methods or boundaries change

Always consider the context when interpreting large percentage changes.

The year-over-year number, however, **only shows the change between the selected year and the previous year**, and is not necessarily aligned with the company’s own climate targets or tracking.

**Most companies track their climate progress based on a selected “base year”** (such as 2019 or 2020), and measure reductions from that starting point.
