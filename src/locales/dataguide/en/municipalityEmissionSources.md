# Where Do Emissions Come From — and What Can You Do About Them?

Your municipality’s emissions come from different everyday activities — heating homes, driving cars, using electricity, and even what we eat.

Here’s what some of the categories mean for your daily life, and what to look out for:

**Transport**
Often the biggest local source — mostly from petrol/diesel cars and work vehicles.

As a resident:

- Choose walking, biking, buses or carpools when you can
- Consider an electric car — especially if your area offers public charging or free parking for EVs
- Support bike lanes, bus routes, and traffic calming in your area
- Push your municipality to electrify school buses and service vehicles

**Heating & Energy Use in Buildings**
Includes home heating (like oil boilers or electric radiators), and electricity from fossil sources.

As a resident:

- Check if your home is on fossil-free district heating
- Ask your landlord or housing cooperative about switching to a heat pump
- Use less energy (lower thermostat, LED lights, turn things off)
- Encourage energy upgrades in local schools and public buildings

**Industry & Construction**
In some municipalities, especially those with factories or cement plants, industry is a major source.

As a resident:

- Support reuse and renovation instead of new construction when possible
- Ask your municipality about fossil-free building standards for public projects
- Pay attention to large infrastructure projects (roads, data centres, etc.) — are they climate-smart?

**Product Use & Waste**
Includes certain chemicals, refrigerants, and products with high emissions when made or thrown away.

As a resident:

- Recycle correctly and avoid buying things you don’t need
- Use electronics and appliances longer instead of upgrading often
- Look for “green” refrigerants in new appliances (like fridges and ACs)

**Agriculture & Food**
In rural areas, agriculture is often a large source — mostly from livestock and fertilizer use.

As a resident:

- Choose more plant-based meals when you can
- Support local farms using climate-friendly practices
- Ask your municipality to serve more climate-smart food in schools and elderly care

**What to Watch for in Local Policy**
Even if you don’t work in industry or build roads, your voice matters. Keep an eye on local decisions like:

- New building projects: Are they fossil-free and energy-smart?
- Public transport expansions or cuts
- School food and municipal food policies
- Public procurement: Are your tax krona funding climate-friendly choices?
- Citizen proposals (“medborgarförslag”) or budget allocations — get involved!
