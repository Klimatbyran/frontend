# Why are some companies missing data for certain scopes or years?

Some companies may not have systems in place to track full emissions, or may only report what’s legally required or easiest to calculate.

Others might be new to reporting, have changed methods, or only report certain scopes (like Scope 1 and 2, but not Scope 3).

Gaps in data don’t automatically mean bad intent — but they do make it harder to judge progress or compare companies fairly.
