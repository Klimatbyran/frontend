# Charging Points

This shows how many electric cars there are for every available public charging point.

A **lower** number means easier access. A **higher** number could mean queues or underinvestment in charging infrastructure.

Rule of thumb:

- <5 cars per charger = good accessibility
- 5â€“10 = adequate
- 10 = likely bottlenecks
