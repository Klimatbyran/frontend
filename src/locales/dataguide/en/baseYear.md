# What is a base year?

A **base year** is the year a company chooses as the starting point for tracking its

climate progress. All future emission reductions are usually measured **in

comparison to this year**.

For example, if a company set its base year as 2020 and aimed to cut emissions by

50% by 2030, all reductions would be measured *relative to its 2020 emissions**.

**Why it matters:** The base year provides a consistent reference point to measure

long-term progress. Without it, it’s hard to know whether a company is actually

reducing emissions — or just fluctuating year to year.

**Note:** Some companies update their base year if they change how they calculate

emissions or if they undergo a major restructuring (like a merger or acquisition).
