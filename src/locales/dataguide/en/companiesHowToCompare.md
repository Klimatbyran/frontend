# How can I use this information to compare companies fairly?

Start by comparing companies **within the same industry**, as different sectors have very different emissions profiles. You can also look at **emissions per million in revenue** (emissions intensity), which helps adjust for company size.

Finally, consider how complete their reporting is â€” a company that reports all scopes, even if the numbers are high, is often showing more transparency than one that reports very little.
