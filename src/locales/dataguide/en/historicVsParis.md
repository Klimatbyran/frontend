# How Can They Be “On Track for Paris” If Their Historic % Is Lower?
It may seem strange that a historic change like **–4% per year** can be on track when it looks so different from the Paris Path of **–11.72% per year**.  
The reason is simple: these numbers describe **different things**.

## 1. A Dirt Pile as a Carbon Budget
Imagine you have a **300 kg pile of dirt** you must move within **3 hours** before the rain arrives.  
That 300 kg is your **carbon budget**: a total amount that must be dealt with over a fixed time period.

## 2. The Percentage-Based Plan (Carbon Law)
A landscape expert gives you a plan:

> “Aim to remove **about 12%** of what remains every 10 minutes in order to clear the dirt in time.”

This is a **percentage-based pathway** — large removals at the beginning, smaller ones later.

And it is **one path** that would both clear all the dirt and stay within the 3-hour limit.  

## 3. Your Expected Path (Trendline)
From past projects, you know your natural pace:

- you fill a wheelbarrow with **about 10 kg of dirt every 10 minutes**,  
- and you can keep this up steadily.

This is a **fixed absolute reduction**, not a percentage. It forms a **straight-line trend**, just like the LAD trendline in our emissions calculations.

At the beginning, 10 kg out of 300 kg is only **around 3%**—much lower than the expert’s recommended 12%. But as the pile shrinks, the same 10 kg becomes **5%, 8%, 12%, 20%**, and so on.

## 4. What Really Matters: The Total Removed
After 3 hours, only one thing determines success:

**Did you move all ~300 kg?**

If your steady 10 kg every 10 minutes is enough to clear the entire pile in time, you succeeded—even though your early percentages were far below 12%.

This mirrors how we judge if an organisation is on track to be Paris aligned:
- the Paris Path gives a **reference percentage curve**,  
- but what counts is whether **total emissions from 2025–2050** stay within the defined **carbon budget** and they reach net zero.

A linear trendline with steady absolute reductions can still keep the total low enough, even if the historic percentage looks small.

## 5. When It Would Fail
This only works if the **absolute reductions are large enough**.

If you were removing only **5 kg every 10 minutes** instead of 10 kg, you wouldn’t clear the pile in time —  
just as too-small emission cuts would fail to stay within the Paris-aligned carbon budget.
