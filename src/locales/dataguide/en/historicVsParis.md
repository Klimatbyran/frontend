# Why Historic Percentage Change Does Not Match the Paris Path

It is common to wonder why a municipality or company might have a historic reduction rate of, for example, **–4% per year**, while the Paris-aligned Carbon Law requires **–11.72% per year**, and yet still be assessed as “On Track”. These numbers measure different things and cannot be compared directly.

## Historic % Change = Past Behaviour
The historic rate shows how emissions have changed **in percentage terms** in the past.  
It is an exponential measure (e.g., –4% per year from 2015–2023) and tells us something about past performance — not about the future pathway.

## Trend Line (LAD) = Future Tonnes, Not Percentages
Our trend model predicts future emissions in **tonnes per year**, not percentages.  
A fixed drop in tonnes becomes a larger percentage as emissions get smaller, so the trend line will never resemble a smooth –11.72% curve.

This means the historic % and the trend line % are fundamentally different from the Paris % path.

## Paris Path = Required Future % Change
Carbon Law describes how emissions *should* fall from 2025 onward to stay compatible with a 1.5°C carbon budget. That –11.72% per year is a **future requirement**, not a measure of the past.

## Why an Organisation Can Still Be “On Track”
Paris alignment is based on **total emissions between 2025 and 2050**, not on matching a specific yearly percentage.  
Even with a slower historic % rate, the future trend may still result in **lower total cumulative emissions** than the Paris-aligned carbon budget allows. If the total stays below that budget, the organisation is considered *On Track*.

## Quick Analogy
Saving 10% of your income every month is the ideal plan.  
But what matters most is **how much you saved by the end of the year**. Even with uneven saving patterns — some low months, some high months — you can still reach or exceed the yearly goal.

Paris alignment works the same way:  
**Total emissions matter more than matching the exact percentage every year.**

## Why Slow Reductions Today Mean Steeper Cuts Later
The Paris-aligned carbon budget is fixed.  
If an organisation reduces emissions **more slowly in the early years**, meeting the same total budget later requires **much sharper reductions**. At some point, delaying reductions can make the required catch-up nearly impossible.

This is the same as postponing savings: if you do not save in the first half of the year, the remaining months require much higher savings to reach the yearly goal — or the target becomes unrealistic.
