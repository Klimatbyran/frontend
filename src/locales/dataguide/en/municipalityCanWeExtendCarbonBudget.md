# Can we revise or extend the carbon budget?

Not really — the carbon budget is set by physics, not politics. It reflects how much CO₂ the atmosphere can absorb before we exceed 1.5 °C of warming. Once the budget is used up, we can’t negotiate for more time — overshooting just increases the risks.

**What about carbon dioxide removal (CDR)?**

CDR methods like biochar, direct air capture, and enhanced weathering could one day help remove CO₂ from the atmosphere — but they are not yet available at the scale or speed needed. Most are still expensive, energy-intensive, and not widely deployed. That means we cannot rely on CDR to “buy more time” — it may help later, but it cannot replace rapid emissions cuts today.

**There’s another risk:**

If the climate warms too much, natural carbon sinks like forests and peatlands may stop absorbing carbon and instead begin releasing it — turning from buffers into sources. That would shrink the remaining global budget even further, making our task even harder.
This is why staying within the original budget matters so much. Acting now helps protect both the climate and the natural systems that support it.
