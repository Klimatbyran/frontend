# What is Scope 3

**Scope 3 – Other indirect emissions (supply chain and beyond)**

Scope 3 is the broadest category. It includes **all other emissions connected to the company**, both **before and after** its operations — even if the company doesn’t directly control them.

Scope 3 is split into two parts:

**Upstream emissions** (before the product reaches the company):
- Making and transporting raw materials
- Emissions from suppliers
- Business travel or employee commuting

**Downstream emissions** (after the company sells the product):
- How customers use the product
- How the product is disposed of or recycled
- Investments or services the company funds
