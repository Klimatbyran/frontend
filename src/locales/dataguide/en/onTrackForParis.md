# How We Decide If a Company Is “On Track for Paris”

To understand whether a company or municipality is aligned with the Paris Agreement, we look at their **total emissions from 2025 to 2050**. This total amount acts as an emissions **budget**. If they stay under this budget, they are considered *On Track* for Paris.

We calculate this using two paths: one from the Paris-aligned Carbon Law, and one based on the organisation’s own emissions trend.

## The Paris-Aligned “Carbon Budget”

The Carbon Law says emissions need to fall by **11.72% every year**. This creates a smooth exponential downward curve.

When we add up all the emissions on this curve from 2025–2050, we get the organisation’s **Paris-aligned carbon budget** – the maximum amount of emissions they can “spend” over this period and still be compatible with a 1.5°C pathway.

## The Organisation’s Trend Line

To project future emissions, we use a simple trend line (LAD) based on how emissions have changed in **tonnes per year** historically. This produces a straight-line forecast of future emissions in absolute terms, not a fixed % per year.

We then add up the trendline values from 2025–2050 to get the **projected total emissions**.

## How We Determine “On Track”

We compare the two totals:

- **If total projected emissions < Paris-aligned budget → the organisation is “On Track”.**
- **If total projected emissions > Paris-aligned budget → the organisation is “Not On Track”.**

This judgement is based on **total emissions over time**, not on whether the organisation matches the Carbon Law curve every single year.

## Analogy: Saving 10% of your salary every month

Imagine you earn 30,000 SEK each month and set yourself a goal:

- “I want to save **10% every month**,”  
- which would give you **36,000 SEK per year** if you follow it exactly.

But in real life you might:

- save only 5% some months,
- save 20% in others,
- and maybe skip saving in a difficult month.

In the end, what matters most is:

- **How much you have saved in total by the end of the year**, not whether every month was exactly 10%.

If you end the year with **more than 36,000 SEK saved**, then *on average* your savings rate over the year has been at least as strong as 10% – even if it didn’t look like 10% each month.

Our Paris calculation works in a similar way:

- Carbon Law’s **11.72% per year** is like a “save 10% every month” rule.
- The **Paris carbon budget** is like the “36,000 SEK by the end of the year” target.
- The organisation’s **trendline emissions** are like what they actually save and spend in each month.

If the **total emissions 2025–2050 are lower than the Paris carbon budget**, then in hindsight their *effective* average reduction over the period has been at least as strong as the Carbon Law pathway, even if the year-by-year % changes were uneven and did not look like a smooth 11.72% curve.

## Simple Visual Summary
      PARIS ALIGNED PATH (Carbon Law)
      ↓ 11.72% per year
      → Add up all emissions 2025–2050 = Allowed Total

      COMPANY TREND LINE
      ↓ Based on past data in tonnes/year
      → Add up projected emissions 2025–2050 = Projected Total

COMPARE:
      Is Projected Total < Allowed Total?
      ✔ YES → On Track
      ✘ NO  → Not On Track
