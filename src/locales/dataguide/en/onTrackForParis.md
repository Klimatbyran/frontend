# How We Calculate “On Track for Paris”

“On Track for Paris” means an organisation’s **total projected emissions from 2025–2050** fit within a Paris-aligned carbon budget.

We begin with a 2025 value for the organisation’s emissions. If the most recent measured year is earlier, we estimate 2025 using the historical trend.

This starting point is used for both:
- the **Carbon Law pathway**, and  
- the **trendline projection**
so that both paths are directly comparable.

### 1. Paris Path (Carbon Law)
We calculate a Paris-aligned pathway using **–11.72% per year** (Carbon Law).  
The *total* emissions allowed along this curve form a **carbon budget** for 2025–2050.

### 2. Trendline Projection
We estimate future emissions with a **linear LAD trendline**, based on historical data. This gives a **steady change in tonnes per year** rather than a fixed percentage.  
We extend this trendline from 2025 to 2050 and sum the **total projected emissions**.

### 3. Compare the Totals
Paris alignment is determined by comparing the entity's:

- **Trendline total emissions (2025–2050)**  
- **Total carbon budget (2025–2050)**

If the trendline total is **lower** than the budget, the organisation is marked as **On Track for Paris**.  
If it is **higher**, it is **Not On Track**.

This method evaluates the **full emissions pathway**, not whether each year matches the –11.72% rate.
