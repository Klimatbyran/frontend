# Why relate to an individual?

To make the emissions change easier to understand, we compare it to the average annual emissions per person. In our case, we assume that an average person accounts for approximately 7.6 tons of CO₂-equivalents (tCO₂e) per year. This is based on data from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, which states that “the average carbon footprint per person and year in Sweden is 7.6 tonnes(2)“.

By dividing the emissions change by this per-person value, we obtain a number representing how many “people” it corresponds to — providing users with a simpler and more relatable way to grasp the scale of the change.
